# End-Use Savings Shapes (EUSS)

## Motivation
Building on the successfully completed effort to calibrate and validate DOE’s ResStock™ and ComStock™ models over the past three years, the objective of this work is to produce national datasets that empower analysts working for federal, state, utility, city, and manufacturer stakeholders to answer a broad range of analysis questions. The goal of this work is to develop energy efficiency, electrification, and demand flexibility end-use load shapes (electricity, gas, propane, or fuel oil) that covers a majority of the high-impact, market-ready (or nearly market-ready) measures. An end-use savings shape (EUSS) is the difference in energy consumption between a baseline building and a building with an energy efficiency, electrification, or demand flexibility measure applied.  It results in a timeseries profile that is broken down by end-use and fuel (electricity or on-site gas, propane, or fuel oil use) at each timestep.

## Highlights
put short summary of results (with visuals) and point to detailed references (e.g., documentation, report, paper, etc.)

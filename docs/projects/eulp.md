# End-Use Load Profiles (EULP) for the U.S. Building Stock

## Motivation
NREL and its research partners have developed a database of end-use load profiles (EULP) representing all major end uses, building types, and climate regions in the U.S. commercial and residential building stock.

End-use load profiles are critically important to understanding the time-sensitive value of energy efficiency, demand response, and other distributed energy resources. This foundational dataset can help electric utilities, grid operators, manufacturers, government entities, and research organizations make critical decisions about prioritizing research and development, utility resource and distribution system planning, and state and local energy planning and regulation.

The team, which includes Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and Argonne National Laboratory, used an innovative approach that benefited from the reach, cost-effectiveness, and granularity of physics-based building stock modeling using the ResStock™ and ComStock™ capabilities developed by NREL for the U.S. Department of Energy. These stock models have been informed by and validated against the best-available ground-truth data—from whole-building interval meter data, submetering studies, and other data sources. The resulting public database was generated using the stock models and does not contain the ground-truth data used to develop and calibrate the models.

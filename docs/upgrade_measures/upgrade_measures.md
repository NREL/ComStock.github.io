# Upgrade Measures
{: .fw-500 }
See the table, below, for a complete list of available upgrade measures and packages in ComStock datasets, including a link to their documentation, and in which dataset release the measure was first included.

The measure documentation describes the modeling methodology, assumptions, relevant ComStock baseline features, and observations from results. The assumptions used for the measures represent one of multiple possible approaches for a technology. They are intended to be reasonable but not necessarily optimal. Assumptions can be modified as our understanding of the technologies improves. The ComStock model is continuously updated with new information, methods, and improved quality assurance/quality control procedures.

New datasets include new upgrade measures as well as updates to the ComStock baseline model. Some dataset releases and new measures are introduced with a webinar presentation. The webinars provide an overview of the ComStock process, high-level national observations for each new upgrade measure, and guidance for accessing various features of the dataset. Though not presented on the release webinar, each new dataset release includes all existing measures from the previous releases.

In ComStock datasets, the upgrades are assigned an "upgrade_id." This ID may change across dataset releases for a given upgrade. We make a **measure_name_crosswalk.csv** file available that relates the universal "Measure ID" in the table, below, and the upgrade_ids for each release. The **measure_name_crosswalk.csv** is available on the OEDI Data Lake, or you can download the latest file, [here][1].

Release webinar recordings and slides can be found at the [bottom of the page](#release-webinar-recordings-and-slides). Please note that webinars are not held for every ComStock dataset release.

**[Join our mailing list](https://www.nrel.gov/buildings/end-use-load-profiles.html#contact)** to receive notifications on upcoming releases and for invitations to the live webinar presentations.

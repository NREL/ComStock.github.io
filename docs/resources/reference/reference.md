# Reference

ComStock's reference is broken down into two separate categories. The first, documentation included under the ComStock link below details the representation of the baseline stock, including but not limited to the underlying stock model, the sampling regime, the energy modeling process, key modeling assumptions, and the broader analysis workflow. The second reference set, available under the Upgrade Measures link below, details the energy modeling for the efficiency and electrification measures published through the End Use Savings Shape body of work.

# How-to: Understand the annual energy use by building type for a city.

This guide will walk you through how to prepare city-level ComStock data for analysis using the following example statement:

**I want to understand the annual energy use by building type for the city of Richmond, CA.**

ComStock has multiple fields that indicate where models are located
across the country. When conducting analysis for a city using the
publicly available ComStock dataset, Public Use Microdata Area
(PUMA)-level data is the appropriate geographic area to use for
filtering the data to a city. PUMAs are non-overlapping, statistical
geographic areas that partition each state or equivalent entity into
geographic areas containing no fewer than 100,000 people each used by
the Census Bureau and State Data Centers (SDCs).
This document will walk through the steps
required to download and prepare ComStock data using Microsoft Excel for
conducting analysis using the city of Richmond, CA as an example. By the
end of these steps, the data can be put directly into the "Basic
Building Stock Characterization" workbook template to auto-generate
figures, or any other data analysis tool.

There are five steps required to download PUMA-level data from ComStock
and prepare it for analysis. First, identify which PUMAs represent the
area of interest -- in this case, Richmond, CA. Second, we identify gaps
in the ComStock models for the given PUMA. Third, we choose a strategy
for filling in the gaps. Fourth, we apply the strategy and calculate
updated weights for the ComStock model results. Finally, we apply the
new weights to prepare the results for analysis.

Note: Text in **bold** refers to a column in an excel sheet. In the case
of the local data source the names of the individual columns will depend
on the data source, and so we use descriptive column names. Text in
*italics* describes a sheet in the excel workbook. Text in "quotes"
specifies values expected in a cell or cells. <u>Underlined</u>
text specifies an excel function.

### Step 1: Identify which PUMAs represent the geography of interest.

1.  Download the map file for the Census Region covering the area from
    the [ComStock OEDI data
    lake](https://data.openei.org/s3_viewer?bucket=oedi-data-lake&prefix=nrel-pds-building-stock%2Fend-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock%2F2023%2Fcomstock_amy2018_release_1%2Fgeographic_information%2F)
    geographic information folder.

    1.  Select the file that best matches your geography. Please refer
        to [this Census
        map](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf)
        to determine which you should download. For this example, we
        will select "map_of_pumas_in_census_region_4_west.geojson" to
        get PUMAs in California.

    2.  Avoid downloading the map of the whole U.S. as the file is too
        large to be opened by most GeoJSON viewers.

2.  Open the file in a GeoJSON viewer such as <https://geojson.io>.

    1.  Wait for the file to load.

    2.  Use the search bar to find your location; in this case, enter
        "Richmond, CA" in the search bar.

    3.  Click on the PUMA(s) that best encompass the area of interest to
        load the information for that PUMA.

    4.  Note the GISJOIN field -- this is what you will use to filter
        the ComStock results.

        1.  Example for Richmond, CA:\
            GISJOIN: G06001301\
            Name: Contra Costa County (Far Southwest)\--Richmond
            (Southwest) & San Pablo Cities PUMA

            ![](../../../assets/images/Richmond_geojson.png)

            Figure 1. Example of searching Census Region 4's geojson file for
            'Richmond, California'. Note the GISJOIN field, which is used in Step 2.

### Step 2: Identify gaps in the PUMA-level ComStock models.

The ComStock dataset includes architypical models that represent collections of real buildings and
is sampled at the national level. At a finer geographic resolution, for example at a PUMA-level,
there are going to be segments of the building stock that are underrepresented by the Comstock dataset. It is
critical to identify and fill these gaps to perform meaningful analysis. To do this follow the instructions below:

1.  Download the ComStock metadata CSV file from
    [OEDI](https://data.openei.org/s3_viewer?bucket=oedi-data-lake&prefix=nrel-pds-building-stock%2Fend-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock).

2.  Using Microsoft Excel, open the file and save it as an .xlsx file.

3.  Using the **in.nhgis_puma_gisjoin** column, down select the data to
    the PUMA(s) of the area you are interested in. Use the GISJOIN
    values found in Step 1 -- in the case of the Richmond, CA this would
    be "G06001301"

4.  In the same file, create a second sheet and copy the down-selected
    data to it. Rename it *Richmond, CA*.

5.  From the *Richmond, CA* sheet, create a PivotTable.

    1.  Drag the field **in.comstock_building_type_group** into the
        "Rows" and "Values" sections in the PivotTable Fields sidebar on
        the right. This will show how many samples of each building type
        group are in your area of interest.

    2.  For Richmond, CA, the count for each ComStock building type
        group is as follows:\
        ![](../../../assets/images/Richmond_btype_count.png)

    3.  First, note which groups have less than 5 samples. These have
        the potential to lead to inaccurate results when they are
        scaled. In Richmond, "Education" and "Food Service" groups have
        low sample counts and should be investigated further.

        1.  Add **weight** to the "Values" section in the right sidebar.
            This will show the approximate total building count for each
            building type group.\
            ![](../../../assets/images/Richmond_btype_area.png)

        2. Take note of the **Sum of weight** value for the building
            type groups with less than 5 samples ("Education" and "Food
            Service").

        3. Using Google Maps or other available data source, estimate
             the number of actual buildings of these building type
             groups in the area of interest and compare against the
             **Sum of weight** values. There are about 15 Education
             buildings, and at least 20 Food Service buildings in
             Richmond (Figure 2, Figure 3). This indicates ComStock is
             underestimating the number of Education buildings, and for
             the most part accurately representing the Food Service
             Buildings. Takeaway: Education buildings are a gap.

             ![](../../../assets/images/Richmond_education.png)

             Figure 2. Education buildings in Richmond, CA

             ![](../../../assets/images/Richmond_food_service.png)

             Figure 3. Food service buildings in Richmond, CA

    4. Second, compare the list of ComStock building type groups against
        the complete list (Table 1). The "Lodging" group is missing from the
        Richmond PUMA. This group should also be investigated further.

        Table 1. List of ComStock building type groups

        | **ComStock Building Type Groups** |
        | Education |
        | Food Service |
        | Healthcare |
        | **<u>Lodging</u>** |
        | Mercantile |
        | Office |
        | Warehouse and Storage |

        1.  Verify whether this is realistic or a byproduct of national-level
            sampling. Using Google Maps or other available data source, look up
            each missing building type group in the area of interest. The
            lodging facilities in Richmond, CA are shown the screenshot in
            Figure 4. There are certainly hotels and motels in this area.

            ![](../../../assets/images/Richmond_lodging.png)

### Step 3: Choose a strategy to fill in the gaps.

The simplest way to fill in the gaps identified in Step 2 is to add
building models from a neighboring geography. For this, use your
knowledge of the surrounding area and other data sources, such as Google
Maps, to identify which neighboring geographies have similar building
stock to the PUMA(s) of interest. The following steps outline the
process that was used for Richmond.

1.  We first examine models in neighboring PUMAs that have similar
    building stock. Of the PUMAs adjacent to "G06001301," only
    "G06000101" has Lodging models in it, and there is only 1. This will
    not be sufficient to perform any analysis with, so we will try a
    different approach.

2.  We next consider the county that Richmond is in -- Contra Costa
    County. A Google Maps search indicates that the building stock in
    Richmond is similar to the building stock across the county.
    Additionally, Contra Costa County includes 853 ComStock models, of
    which 9 are Lodging, and 30 are Education -- this is a substantial
    improvement, and we will use this to move forward in conducting the
    analysis.

### Step 4: Apply the strategy and calculate updated weights for the ComStock model results.

Once you have identified the appropriate strategy to fill in the gaps,
you will apply the strategy and update the ComStock weights. This step
is critically important because it will affect the scaling of the energy
results. The following instructions will go over the steps for the
county strategy that was determined as the best fit for Richmond.
However, you would follow similar steps if you were to use a different
strategy, such as adding data from a neighboring PUMA.

Note that if you have access to an additional data source that specifies
the square footage of various building types within the geography (e.g.,
an Accessors Database or information from the local school district's
website), alternative weighting options are available that may be
significantly more accurate. Please use judgment and refer to the
ComStock How-To Guide on Using Local Data Sources.

For the county strategy, we will scale the weights in the ComStock
results by the ratio of Richmond PUMA total building floor area to
Contra Costa County total building floor area. This will ensure the
total building floor area matches the Richmond building floor area.

1.  Create a new PivotTable from the data in the *Richmond, CA* sheet.

    1.  Drag the field **in.comstock_building_type_group** into the
        "Rows" and **in.weighted.floor_area..f2** into the "Values"
        sections in the PivotTable Fields sidebar on the right. The
        value listed as "Grand Total" at the bottom of the PivotTable
        indicates the total commercial building floor area modeled by
        ComStock in that PUMA.

2.  Down select the national metadata by county to include Contra Costa
    County -- "G0600130" -- and copy it to a separate sheet. Rename the
    new sheet *Contra Costa County*.

3.  Create a PivotTable of the county down-selected data. Rename the new
    sheet *Contra Costa Pivot*.

    1.  Drag the field **in.comstock_building_type_group** into the
        "Rows" and **in.weighted.floor_area..f2** into the "Values"
        sections in the PivotTable Fields sidebar on the right. The
        value listed as "Grand Total" at the bottom of the PivotTable
        indicates the total commercial building floor area modeled by
        ComStock in Contra Costa County.

4.  Create a new sheet and copy the county down-selected data to it.
    Rename the sheet *Richmond Adjusted*.

5.  Create a new column in the *Richmond Adjusted* sheet on the far
    right of the data and title it **new_weight**.

6.  Identify the column letter of the **out.weight** column. In this
    example, it is column NY.

7.  In the row 2 of the **new_weight** column, use the following formula
    to calculate the new weight.\
    <u>=NY2 \* GETPIVOTDATA(\"in.weighted.floor_area..ft2\",\'Richmond
    Pivot\'!\$A\$3) /
    GETPIVOTDATA(\"in.weighted.floor_area..ft2\",\'Contra Costa
    Pivot\'!\$A\$3)</u>\
    \* Replace NY2 with the appropriate column in your data file.

8.  Drag and fill the rest of the **new_weight** column with this
    formula.

### Step 5: Apply new weights to conduct analysis.

This step uses the **new_weight** column calculated in Step 4 to
generate columns to use for analysis. In this example, we will generate
the columns that are used in the "Basic Building Stock Characterization"
workbook template .

1.  Multiply the **new_weight** column by the unweighted column of
    interest.

2.  For example, to create a new column capturing the interior equipment
    energy consumption, first create a new column in the *Richmond
    Adjusted* sheet. In row 2 of the new column, multiply **new_weight**
    by **Interior Equipment..kWh** and fill the remaining cells in the
    column.

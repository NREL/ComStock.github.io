# Energy Efficiency and Electrification Measure Documentation
{: .fw-500 }
All measures detailed below have been developed through the End Use Savings Shape project, specifically the 2023 Release 1 and 2 efforts.

The measure documentation describes the modeling methodology, assumptions, relevant ComStock baseline features, and observations from results.

The assumptions used for the measures represent one of multiple possible approaches for a technology. They are intended to be reasonableÂ but not necessarily optimal. Assumptions can be modified as our understanding of the technologies improves. The ComStock model is continuously updated with new information, methods, and improved quality assurance/quality control procedures. Datasets are released in 6-month increments.

The webinar presentation introduces the dataset 2023 Release 1 and provides high level national observations for each measure. The webinar recording and slides are available online:

# Energy Efficiency and Electrification Measure Documentation
{: .fw-500 }
All measures detailed below have been developed through the End Use Savings Shape project, specifically the 2023 Release 1 and 2 efforts.

The measure documentation describes the modeling methodology, assumptions, relevant ComStock baseline features, and observations from results.

The assumptions used for the measures represent one of multiple possible approaches for a technology. They are intended to be reasonableÂ but not necessarily optimal. Assumptions can be modified as our understanding of the technologies improves. The ComStock model is continuously updated with new information, methods, and improved quality assurance/quality control procedures. Datasets are released in 6-month increments.

New measures are released every 6 months. Each release includes a webinar presentation introducing the new dataset. The webinars provide an overview of ComStock, high level national observations for each new upgrade measure, and some guidance for accessing various features of the dataset.

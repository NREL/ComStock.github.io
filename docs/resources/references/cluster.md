# Geographic Clustering Reference Documentation
{: .fw-500 }
This document provides reference documentation for the clustering methodology developed by ComStock. The clustering algorithm described in this technical report resulted in 88 clusters across the United States. The clusters are used as the geographic basis for the “U.S. Building Stock Segmentation Series” published by DOE’s Building Technologies Office (BTO). This series will provide geographically relevant insight into building stock characteristics, energy and emissions performance, and, eventually, common end use technologies.
